    <h2>Why you should learn more about components</h2>
    <p>
      Having build frontends in multiple frameworks, I'm fascinated by how all these frameworks converge on the very same idea
      of a reusable component.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it really is a repeating pattern. You have a component which encapsulates state, logic and even styling. With props in
      and events out, you can use these components to compose complex UIs.
    </p>

    <p>It is therefore well worth to invest more time in learning how to work with components effectively</p>
