  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve gone through all <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a> tests making sure that they compile cleanly. Also, changed the ant <pre>build.xml</pre> script, to stop creating release packages if any tests fail. So, this is the first hurdle for releasing Columba.I&#8217;ve got Timo to fix an annoying SMTP open connection bug, caused by to strict assumptions of <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/subprojects_ristretto.php">Ristretto.</a> Should now work much better with servers which aren&#8217;t strictly RFC-compliant.Forwarding messages works correctly again, too. An inputstream was accidently closed too early.Also gone through the README, COMPILE and CHANGES docs and brought them up-to-date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve finally finished my exams and thesis paper. So, starting with todayI&#8217;m back developing on Columba againFirst of all the roadmap at <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap">http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap</a>is slightly outdated. I&#8217;m going to update the items list this week. The M3 releaseis going to happen at Mai the 30th. Furthermore, I&#8217;m planning to dotesting releases on Mai the 8th and Mai the 16th.This is the last Milestone release, which should be much more stable andpolished as compared to M2, which sadly contained a couple of veryannoying bugs. The testing releases, the new testcases and a soon to beupdated Smoketest (<a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Smoketest">http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Smoketest</a>)will ensure this.Last Milestone also means, last version with new major features. This isthe reason why I would like to call it v1.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1), insteadof Milestone M3. Afterwards only RC will be released until Columba is stableenough for a final 1.0 version. This also includes user/developer documentation.My feeling is that this will happen around 2 months later.I know that many people would like to see much more new features in Columba,including changing it into a complete Groupware solution comparable to MS Outlookand other apps.Timo and me concluded a while ago that the best for Columba will be to get astable release out of the door as fast as possible. With such a stable version,it will be very easy to add additional features or even concentrate more ona complete collaboration tool. Users will most likely do without a missing feature,but they won&#8217;t use beta software.Considering the latest discussions (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html)</a>)about creating open-source software with good user interfaces, robustness andcomplete documentation my feeling is that this is a very reasonable plan.So, stay tuned.</p>

<p>Its raining outside, a good day to fix some smaller issues in Columba.First of all I externalized all pending strings in the Account Dialog most notably the Spam Filter Options Panel, where I also fixed the layout.Afterwards I&#8217;ve assigned every modal JDialog a correct parent JFrame, instead of just passing null. I hope this fixes the focus/window handling users noticed, as reported in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=866186&amp;group_id=21217&amp;atid=121217">bugtracker</a>.Additionally, all plugins now compile cleanly. Use and the buid.xml script in the plugins directory to build all plugins. This script stops execution if a build fails. The buildall.sh shell script skips compile errors, so you can make sure that all working plugins compile.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Waking up this morning I recognized that I&#8217;ve forgotten something really important for the token database.I&#8217;m using MD5 sums to detect already learned messages. These shouldn&#8217;t be added to the token database twice or more times - just once. When marking messages as spam, which are non spam, Columba should use this MD5 sum to correct the value, if the user marks the message as non spam.You can imagine that this MD5 message list is getting hugh over time. So, I&#8217;ve added a timestamp for every MD5 sum. This way, cleaning up the token database is very easy because I can just remove old messages.Sadly, this means that the spam.db file format has changed a bit.Another new thing are handcrafted rules. This is pretty new, I&#8217;ve got it from a paper &#8220;A bayesian approach to filtering junk email&#8221; from Sahami et. al.In Columba I&#8217;ve basically eliminated the need for something like a training mode with these rules. The idea is pretty easy. The bayesian classifier enables us to add handcrafted rules, which are handled equally to other tokens. So, a rule just adds another probability additionally to the word probabilities.When starting from scratch you don&#8217;t have any words in your token database. The spam engine can&#8217;t detect spam messages until you trained it for some time. But the handcrafted rules are in place, giving you a good start to determine spam messages, until you have collected enough tokens using the message contents.One such rule would be for example checking if the Subject is of capital letters only, or if the Subject contains many whitespaces. You can think if many more rules. Spamassassin has a very big list of rules which can be found <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/tests.html">here</a>.   Adding new rules is very easy. Just subclass AbstractRule in org.columba.mail.spam.rules.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve added two more filters. The first one is a &#8220;match all&#8221; filter, which just matches all messages. Very handy if you want to apply filters on all messages to cleanup your inbox or doing other repeating stuff.This will become even more useful, when the &#8220;automatically apply filter on new messages&#8221; option is added on a per-folder basis. This way, you can apply filters on newly added messages. This is something many people want. Just drop a message into a folder, execute the filter and process the message data.The other filter checks if the sender already exists in your addressbook. This is currently used in the spam filter anyway, to achieve an automatic whitelisting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Checking the latest CVS sources from <a href="http://columba.sf.net">Columba</a> you will notice the new integrated spam solution. This work is based on my bachelor dissertation. An introduction can be read at <a href="http://frederikdietz.de/jbayesian.php">http://frederikdietz.de</a>. The thesis paper can be downloaded as <a href="http://frederikdietz.de/files/thesis.pdf">pdf file</a>.The spam filter can be enabled in the account configuration. Note, that it takes some time to train this filter. This is done in marking messages as spam or not spam.In the first few days its recommended to just mark the messages as spam. Do not make them move to trash automatically, as its high likely that you will get some false-positives. Also, use the addressbook checking option, which prevents marking messages as spam from people which are already in your addressbook.Its recommended to delete:<pre>[your-config-folder]/mail/main_toolbar.xml</pre>This will create a new toolbar for you, with a mark message as spam button added.In my personal experience, learning around 1000 messages should be enough to make it perform well.There&#8217;s going to be some more fine-tuning needed, especially to make it perform better in the beginning - you have been warned!So, please help me test this beast ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve silently starting on hacking together a prototype for a jabber-based IM client. This is a pretty interesting technology I would love to see integrated in Columba in the future - meaning right after the 1.0 release this summer.Think about receiving a message by your friend. An icon would immediately show his current online/offline/busy state and you can chat right away with him.I&#8217;m still thinking about releasing this client as open-source in the future as stand-alone, but this dependents on user requests.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My exams currently keep me pretty busy until next week. Right now, I&#8217;m totally into DB2 - the second lecture on database, not IBM&#8217;s database - focusing on Object-Oriented and XML databases. Not very exciting, though&#8230;So, finally some news on Columba development. After starting a bigger refactoring of the folder packages in the mail module, I&#8217;ve finished with a testsuite for all types of folders. You can add every foldertype you want and the testcases run over it showing you problems. This should become pretty handy when adding new folders, including new local mailbox formats or even database backed folder implementations.The Filter testsuite covers all plugin-based filters which are shipped by default with Columba. This is more important than you would actually think because these are also the default fallbacks, used in case a search-engine doesn&#8217;t implement all operations. So, implementors of search-engines can just start hacking on their search-engine adding more optimized operations, and falling back to the default engine in case.</p>
