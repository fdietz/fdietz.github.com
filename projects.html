<h3>jwz_threading</h3>
<p>
jwz_threading is a small ruby library which lets you order a list of E-Mails by conversation. That is, grouping messages together in parent/child relationships based on which messages are replies to which others.
</p>
<p>
The library implements the <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html;">JWZ E-Mail threading algorithm</a> as described by Jamie Zawinski. The algorithm is also described in a <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/draft-ietf-imapext-thread-12.txt">IMAP extension draft</a>.

<h3>Columba Email Client</h3>
<p>
Columba is an Email Client written in <a href="http://www.java.sun.com">Java </a>, featuring a user-friendly graphical interface with wizards and internationalization support.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://timostich.de">Timo</a>, a good friend of mine, I've meet at university, and me started this project in 2001. In the beginning our plan was to create a decent mail-client usuable for the two of us. But as we started to open our sourcecode for contributors it became much more.
</p>
<p>
In 2005 Columba has been distributed together with OpenOffice and Firefox by the Indian IT ministry on several millions CDs (for example: <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39237340,00.htm">here</a>, <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39199972,00.htm">here </a>and <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39205447,00.htm">here</a>). Also, in Sept 2005 we have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">Slashdotted</a> and had an all time record of <strong>3,233,231</strong> hits on our website.
