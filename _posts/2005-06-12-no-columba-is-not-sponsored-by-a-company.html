Timo and me are currently preparing some answers for an interview on <a href="http://www.clientjava.com/blog/">ClientJava.com</a>. This first question is "Who sponsors Columba?".

Hmmm... Nobody does. We are a group of open source developers, who like to play with new technologies, most notably Java. And we are convinced that the time is right for Java-based desktop software. We are not a company, selling some product!

To circumvent such confusion in the future, I've added a prominent PayPal donation button on the <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/">front page</a> and also a page <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=138&amp;Itemid=105">dedicated to this matter</a>. Additionally, checkout Timo's and my Amazon wishlist on the page bottom :-)
