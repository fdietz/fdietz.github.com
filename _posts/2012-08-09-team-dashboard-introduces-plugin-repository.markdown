Team Dashboard supports all kinds of data sources. But, there's always something missing.

I'd like to use the [team_dashboard_plugins](https://github.com/fdietz/team_dashboard_plugins) Github repository as the central place to browse, download and request plugins.

More information on how to get started on [github](https://github.com/fdietz/team_dashboard_plugins).
