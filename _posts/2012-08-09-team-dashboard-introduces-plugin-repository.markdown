Team Dashboard supports all kinds of data sources. But, there's always something missing.

I'd like to use the team_dashboard_plugins [Github Repository](https://github.com/fdietz/team_dashboard_plugins) to collect community plugins as the central place to browse, download and request plugins.

More information on how to get started on [github](https://github.com/fdietz/team_dashboard_plugins).
