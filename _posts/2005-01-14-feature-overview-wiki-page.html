I've started writing a <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/FeatureOverview">feature overview page</a>. This is meant for first-time user's who want to check quickly if Columba supports a certain functionality. Of course, this is going to be placed on our website, including some nice screenshots.

Additionally, this is going to be merged with <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Why%20use%20Columba">Why use Columba</a>.

Contributions are welcome!
