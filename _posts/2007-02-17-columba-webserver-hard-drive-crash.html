Columba's server at <a href="http://columbamail.org">http://columbamail.org</a> is currently shutdown due to a hardware failure. The hard drive needs to be replaced. We have backups of nearly everything, so its just a matter of setting up the system again.

For the time being we will keep you posted about the status here.

Funnily we were planning to release a major new version this weekend. So, stay tuned!
