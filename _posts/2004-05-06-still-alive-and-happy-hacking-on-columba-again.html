I've finally finished my exams and thesis paper. So, starting with today
I'm back developing on Columba again

First of all the roadmap at <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap">http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap</a>
is slightly outdated. I'm going to update the items list this week. The M3 release
is going to happen at Mai the 30th. Furthermore, I'm planning to do
testing releases on Mai the 8th and Mai the 16th.

This is the last Milestone release, which should be much more stable and
polished as compared to M2, which sadly contained a couple of very
annoying bugs. The testing releases, the new testcases and a soon to be
updated Smoketest (<a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Smoketest">http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Smoketest</a>)
will ensure this.

Last Milestone also means, last version with new major features. This is
the reason why I would like to call it v1.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1), instead
of Milestone M3. Afterwards only RC will be released until Columba is stable
enough for a final 1.0 version. This also includes user/developer documentation.
My feeling is that this will happen around 2 months later.

I know that many people would like to see much more new features in Columba,
including changing it into a complete Groupware solution comparable to MS Outlook
and other apps.
Timo and me concluded a while ago that the best for Columba will be to get a
stable release out of the door as fast as possible. With such a stable version,
it will be very easy to add additional features or even concentrate more on
a complete collaboration tool. Users will most likely do without a missing feature,
but they won't use beta software.

Considering the latest discussions (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html)">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html)</a>
about creating open-source software with good user interfaces, robustness and
complete documentation my feeling is that this is a very reasonable plan.

So, stay tuned.
