I'm currently planning on releasing a new development snapshot next week. Still working on a couple of bugs, ui issues.This will hopefully be the last development snapshot. This version is currently much more stable than Milestone M2 for me and I'm eager to make users upgrade. People still report the same M2 bugs over and over again, which is a waste of time for both sides.
