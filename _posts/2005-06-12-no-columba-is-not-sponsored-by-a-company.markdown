Timo and me are currently preparing some answers for an interview on [ClientJava.com](http://www.clientjava.com/blog/). This first question is "Who sponsors Columba?".Hmmm... Nobody does. We are a group of open source developers, who like to play with new technologies, most notably Java. And we are convinced that the time is right for Java-based desktop software. We are not a company, selling some product!To circumvent such confusion in the future, I've added a prominent PayPal donation button on the [front page](http://columba.sourceforge.net/) and also a page [dedicated to this matter](http://columba.sourceforge.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=138&Itemid=105). Additionally, checkout Timo's and my Amazon wishlist on the page bottom :-)
