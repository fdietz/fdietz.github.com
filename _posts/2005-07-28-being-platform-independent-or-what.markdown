Just read a user's complain about Columba following [Gnome User Interface Guidelines](http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/). These guidelines also dictact how to layout the menus. For example: the **Preferences **menuitem should always be the last item in the **Edit **menu. At least in Gnome. On Windows it should be better placed in **Utilities**.I actually just saw that in Firefox. They change their menu based on the platform. So, they are more strictly following the platform they are just running on. Whereas we aim to provide the same experience for user's on all platforms.And my feeling is that we do right so. Many of our users choose Columba, because its written in Java, and because you can use it on every operating system and even reuse one single configuration folder. These users would be really upset, if the menu layout would change everytime they switch the platform.
