Columba's server at [http://columbamail.org](http://columbamail.org) is currently shutdown due to a hardware failure. The hard drive needs to be replaced. We have backups of nearly everything, so its just a matter of setting up the system again.For the time being we will keep you posted about the status here.Funnily we were planning to release a major new version this weekend. So, stay tuned!
