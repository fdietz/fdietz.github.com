I've started collecting bugs in our [bug-tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=21217&atid=121217) specific to RC2.Our [roadmap](http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap) contains the planned features which will be implemented by Timo (tstich) and me.I've already finished the cleanup of the message list model. Additionally, the new filter toolbar for the mail component is in CVS.
