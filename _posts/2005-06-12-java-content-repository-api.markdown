There's an interesting [article](http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/contentrepository.html) from Frank Sommers on artima.com_Relational and object databases lack many data management features required by modern applications, such as versioning, rich data references, inheritence, or fine-grained security. Content repositories extend databases with such additional capabilities.

This article reviews the Java Content Repository API and its open-source implementation, Apache Jackrabbit, from a developer's perspective.
