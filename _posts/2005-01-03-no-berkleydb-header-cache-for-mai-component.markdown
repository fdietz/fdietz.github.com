I did some prototyping on the weekend and integrated BerkleyDB in Columba as general core service. Additionally, I've added a header-cache implementation which makes use of it.Sadly there are still a couple of smaller issues/annoyances left. I therefore dropped this [RoadMap](http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap) item for now.Nevertheless, I'm finished with code cleanups and optimization of loading/saving speed.
