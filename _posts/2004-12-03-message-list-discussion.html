<!--exhibit:config=ex_pictorialis.cfg-->Timo and me currently investigate possibilities to improve the threaded-view usability. One idea by <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/threads.html">ibm research</a>  came to our mind.  Timo already implemented an arc-viewer control, so we would be able to play around with this thing after the RC2 release.

Maybe, this way we could get rid of the current JTreeTable message-list and replace it with something more generic. The threaded-view capabilities make this old control a pain in the ass.
