Hi developers,I just wanted to let you know that Timo and me are going to work onColumba again in April.Almost all important tasks on our roadmap are finished. Build/Releaseprocess is much easier now. So, hopefully we can do the RC3 release soon.[http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap](http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap)Additionally, I'm tinkering around with some CMS, so that the core teamcan help us keeping our website up-to-date easily. This was way to complexin the past.
