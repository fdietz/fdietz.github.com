I've finally added a new feature;-)The guys from MIIK Ltd. provided us with a free version of their [jniwrapper library](http://www.jniwrapper.com). This library makes it very easy for Java programs to access win32 functionality.I've started with adding trayicon support. So, you can see Columba's program icon in the traybar on Windows. A context-menu giving you some options. I'm planning to add message notification and all this useful stuff later.Hopefully, we will see more use of this library. Things on my mind are for example, better usage of the windows mimetypes (Giat Hana showed interest here), access to the windows registry to automatically detect external tools, import for Outlook messages and contacts, etc.
