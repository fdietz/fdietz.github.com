Just got a message from the [BharateeyaOO ](http://www.ncb.ernet.in/bharateeyaoo/) team, which are currently translating Columba for 6 Indian languages! The BharateeyaOO.o project is an initiative to bring OpenOffice.org  to India in Indian languages and somehow Columba seems to be of interest for them.
