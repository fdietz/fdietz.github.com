title: Day 1 - How to build your own team chat in five days
published: true
---

Hi and welcome to my little experiment! I'd like to built my own team chat in five days and invite you to join me along the way.

You probably know [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/), [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/) and the like. All these are without a doubt excellent services but they are not as open as I'd like them to be. This starts with the fact that there are all data silos and use proprietary protocols and obviously the source code is not open to contribution.

In the next 5 days I'd like to show you how to build your own chat service and will give you a basis you can work with to add your own unique ideas. So, the emphasize here will be learning how to build your own system in comparison to all these hipster startups out there who focus on saving the world ;-)

Since I haven't really done any upfront planing or detailed product definition we both won't really know how this is going to work out or how the final product is going to look like. But, I promise this will not be just another polished blog serious about how to use Socket.IO to implement a chat room :) Instead I'm going to write my progress in this blog on a daily basis and you can join me along for the ride. It'll be hopefully much more personal and give you more insights how I approach such a task.

I will focus much more on the design and implementation challenges on the frontend instead of the backend. So, this will be especially interesting for AngularJS developers who want to learn how to structure more complex projects. Since I'd like to challenge myself, I'm going to use ES6 which is currently not really well documented. But, it is certainly the future of Javascript development and I'm eager to get to know it better in these upcoming days.

As a prerequisite I assume you have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, Javascript and AngularJS - bonus points for NodeJS and things like [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).
