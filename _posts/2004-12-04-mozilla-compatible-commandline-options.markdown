The RC2 release contains the new Mozilla Mail compatible commandline options which makes integration with third-party software much easier. Most notably OpenOffice, which is the main reason why we changed this. See the screenshot on how to configure your OpenOffice to directly send messages with attached documents. Note, that you can either choose Option1 or Option2.
