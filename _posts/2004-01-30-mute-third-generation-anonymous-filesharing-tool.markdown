Found this on [freshmeat](http://www.freshmeat.net):[http://mute-net.sourceforge.net/](http://mute-net.sourceforge.net/)MUTE File Sharing is an anonymous, decentralized search-and-download file sharing system. Several people have described MUTE as the "third generation file sharing network" (From Napster to Gnutella to MUTE, with each generation getting less centralized and more anonymous). MUTE uses algorithms inspired by ant behavior to route all messages, include file transfers, through a mesh network of neighbor connections.Does anyone actually use this? Sounds interesting though...
