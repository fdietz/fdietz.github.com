I'm very pleased to announce that my ebook "Recipes with Angular.js" is now free under [Creative Commons License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US).

That means you are free to copy, distribute, adapt and even make commercial use of it! The [examples repository](https://github.com/fdietz/recipes-with-angular-js-examples) was always free, but now you can also use the [manuscript](https://github.com/fdietz/recipes-with-angular-js-manuscript). Note, that you can still support me and buy the book on [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/recipes-with-angular-js) or [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Recipes-Angular-js-Frederik-Dietz-ebook/dp/B00DK95V48/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389523586&sr=8-1&keywords=recipes+with+angular.js).

Last but not least, I've created a new website [Recipes with Angular.js](http://fdietz.github.io/recipes-with-angular-js/) which contains all the original book's content nicely formatted, with full-text search and direct edit support using [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/). From now on this will be the place to look for new recipes or fine-tune existing ones. Everyone can contribute via github!

Many thanks again for all my readers who initially bought the book and supported the ongoing work!
