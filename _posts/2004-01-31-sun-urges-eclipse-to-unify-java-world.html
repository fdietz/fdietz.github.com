Sounds like Eclipse is already ahead of Sun in this context and SUN is loosing ground here. Why did Sun regret to join the Eclipse Consortium? This way they could start to influence this Consortium, instead of just blaming Eclipse to divide the Java tools world.  Or they could probably think about making Netbeans use the Eclipse plugins and vice versa.

<strong>Update:</strong>
Did you know that they have James Gosling again as head of their development tools divison?
