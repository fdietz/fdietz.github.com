Have been doing some more work on ruby-config again. First of all there's finally some documentation available in the [Readme](http://github.com/fdietz/ruby-config/blob/fc973b5e0d35113593c0912e58113e4fe5167ac9/README.md) file.

Also one can now use "ruby-config --setup" which helps configuring bash's profile to set the ruby and gem paths correctly. Again, this is done really unobtrusive.

First, the task shows you what changes it wants to do, then it prompts you for a yes or no. You can always cancel and apply the changes manually.I've generated a new gem spec with version 0.5. So, please upgrade!
