I've spend a whole day cleaning up the message preview component. The code is now much easier to read. Additionally, its now possible to use a composition-like approach when handling different views. So, you can view messages in messages recursively.Additionally, I'm almost finished with the "show attachments inline" viewer, which directly shows attachment contents if an appropriate viewer is available.Screenshots coming real soon!
