Java Webstart has a couple of very interesting <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/stanleyh/archive/2005/06/java_deployment.html">new features</a>.

Especially the improved desktop integration is very nice, featuring shortcuts creation, file extensions and MIME association and related content integration in the Start Menu.
Additionally, on Windows Java Webstart Applications integrate in the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs Panel.
