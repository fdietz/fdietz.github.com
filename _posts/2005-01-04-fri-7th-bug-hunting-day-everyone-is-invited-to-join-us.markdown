Next Friday, the 7th Jan we are going to have a bug-hunting day. And we need your help to find all those bugs, annoyances and ui inconsistencies.Timo and me are going to be present in IRC, QuakeNet, in the channel #columba. Additionally, also of course in the mailinglist and the forum here ([http://columba.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=support](http://columba.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=support)).We are going to release another Webstart testing release and will do so several times on Friday. This way users can easily test if their reported bugs are fixed correctly without the hassle of a new installation or repetitive updates of Columba.Hope you join us!
