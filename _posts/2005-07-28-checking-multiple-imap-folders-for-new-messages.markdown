Enough people complained about this missing functionality! I've added it to our after 1.0 roadmap.We will add a new dialog similar to the IMAP Subscribe Dialog to select the folders which should be checked automatically.Still, we didn't decide if this is going into core, or will be provided as optional plugin.
