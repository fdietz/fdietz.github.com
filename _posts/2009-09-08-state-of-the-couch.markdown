[http://jan.prima.de/plok/archives/180-The-State-of-the-Couch-The-Invited-Talk-at-the-Erlang-Workshop-at-ICFP-in-Edinburgh-in-2009.html](http://jan.prima.de/plok/archives/180-The-State-of-the-Couch-The-Invited-Talk-at-the-Erlang-Workshop-at-ICFP-in-Edinburgh-in-2009.html)Nice summary of CouchDB's status from Jan Lenhardt speaking at the Erlang Workshop at ICFP in Edinburgh. Especially interesting to me are his concerns for Erlang's "Open Source-ness". Remember how many problems the Java community had with similar problems? Or the benevolent dictatorship problems other projects have? It seems to help initially to get things rollin' but in later stages it becomes more and more of a problem. Let's see what's going to happen next!
