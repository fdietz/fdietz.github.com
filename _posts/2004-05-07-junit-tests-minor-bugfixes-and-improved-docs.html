I've gone through all <a href="http://junit.org">JUnit</a> tests making sure that they compile cleanly. Also, changed the ant <pre>build.xml</pre> script, to stop creating release packages if any tests fail. So, this is the first hurdle for releasing Columba.

I've got Timo to fix an annoying SMTP open connection bug, caused by to strict assumptions of <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/subprojects_ristretto.php">Ristretto.</a> Should now work much better with servers which aren't strictly RFC-compliant.
Forwarding messages works correctly again, too. An inputstream was accidently closed too early.

Also gone through the README, COMPILE and CHANGES docs and brought them up-to-date.
