I've just commited an updated Eclipse <strong>.project</strong> file to CVS.  Every plugin and necessary libraries are now added to the project build settings. This way, doing refactoring in core, the changes will automatically propagate. Or at least, they are marked as bugs ;-) This was way to much work in the past.

Nevertheless, Columba will not use the class files compiled by Eclipse to load the plugins. Instead it will always use the <strong>plugin.jar</strong>. So, you have to run "<code>ant plugins</code>" and compile all of them to see the changes.

I really like this behaviour, but we could also change it. For example, always trying to load the class files from Columba's classpath first would be an option.
