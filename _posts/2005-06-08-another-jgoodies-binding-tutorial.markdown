Rob Smith has written an interesting article [Introduction to JGoodies Binding](http://www.ociweb.com/jnb/jnbJun2005.html).Currently, the Binding framework is not used in Columba, instead we use a simpler approach which works nicely for easy dialogs. Usually, we have a simply model for the data and use updateComponents(boolean), method to pass the data from the model to the view and back.I definitly will take the time to evaluate the further application of Karsten's Binding Framework. Additionally, I'd like to suggest the Validation Framework. There a [demo available](http://www.jgoodies.com/download/demos/validation/validationdemo.jnlp).
