Our bug day didn't went out as good as expected. Sadly, we didn't get a great number of testers. Nevertheless, we were able to solve a couple of very critical problems and finished many features.

Most notably Timo integrated JDIC (<a href="https://jdic.dev.java.net/">https://jdic.dev.java.net/</a>) for the trayicon support and opening attachments with the system's default applications. Also, the cleaned up message viewer component is now capable of viewing attachment's contents inline.

So, all in all we are really satisfied with the work done and are much closer now to a RC3 release. We are probably doing another test release next weekend.
