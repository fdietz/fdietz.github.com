I've started writing a [feature overview page](http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/FeatureOverview). This is meant for first-time user's who want to check quickly if Columba supports a certain functionality. Of course, this is going to be placed on our website, including some nice screenshots.Additionally, this is going to be merged with [Why use Columba](http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Why%20use%20Columba).Contributions are welcome!
