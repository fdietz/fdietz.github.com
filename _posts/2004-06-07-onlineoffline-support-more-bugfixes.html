I've started making use of the new online/offline connection status.

When downloading or sending messages, Columba automatically switches to online state. If in offline status, Columba won't automatically check for new messages.

Fixed bugs:
-  #966413: mimetype viewer doesn't remember apps
-  fixed classcast exception, actions are enabled/disabled correctly again in addressbook
-  group dialog didn't show up in addressbook
-  #968740, can't choose folder in filter dialog, if treemodel is not sorted
