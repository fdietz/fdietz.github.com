Just got a message from Raman from India.  His group is working on localizing OpenOffice, Columba and other important standard software to the Indian language. They got the IT Minister of the coutnry to put Columba on a CD amoung other tools. This CD will be distributed for free with all major Tamil magazines and newspapers and targets 3 million people.See the following links:[http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/16/stories/2005041600292200.htm](http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/16/stories/2005041600292200.htm)[http://www.tamilnation.org/digital/chennai.htm](http://www.tamilnation.org/digital/chennai.htm)[http://www.cdac.in/html/press/2q05/prs_rl164.asp](http://www.cdac.in/html/press/2q05/prs_rl164.asp)[http://www.ildc.in/GIST/htm/email.htm](http://www.ildc.in/GIST/htm/email.htm)
