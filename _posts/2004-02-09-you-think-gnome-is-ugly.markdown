After testing KDE3.2 for some days now, I've to admit that its getting better with every release. But, there are still too many options spreaded everywhere. KDE insists on destroying my font settings when used with Gnome apps. The overall thing looks nice, but the details really need some polishing. Anyway, heads up for a nice release. Hope they concentrate more on usability and user interface polishing.Regarding ui polishing:[http://actsofvolition.com/archives/2004/february/gettingtoknow/#replies](http://actsofvolition.com/archives/2004/february/gettingtoknow/#replies)[http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2001/december/windowsxprough](http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2001/december/windowsxprough)
