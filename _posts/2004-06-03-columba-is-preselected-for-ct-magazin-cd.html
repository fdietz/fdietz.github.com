Columba has been preselected by the german c't magazin (<a href="http://www.heise.de">www.heise.de</a>). If it gets finally selected, we'll end up on their shareware cdrom shipped with the magazin, which includes an article about Columba.

I have been trying to get their attention for one year now, but they refused to write about Columba or post news. Always made me feel silly, because we even got articles from Brasilian magazins, so why not german magazins - at last, both Timo and me are from Germany!

As a c't magazin reader/subscriber for almost 12 years, I'd love to read about my own stuff ;-)
