First of all there's the new filter toolbar. Note, that we now offer complete search functionality inclusive full body search, etc. This is possible because we don't rely on the Table Model anymore. Instead we use the vFolder search functionality. This way your search is automatically saved as a child vFolder of the "Search Results" folder.And then the "view attachment's contents inline" message preview component. This is of course an optional feature. What you actually see here is a message which contains another message as attachment. This is a pretty common case, when forward a message as attachment, which is the default in most email clients today. This also works when using text or image attachments, which looks really sexy :-)
