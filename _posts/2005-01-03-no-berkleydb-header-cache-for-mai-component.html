I did some prototyping on the weekend and integrated BerkleyDB in Columba as general core service. Additionally, I've added a header-cache implementation which makes use of it.

Sadly there are still a couple of smaller issues/annoyances left. I therefore dropped this <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap">RoadMap</a> item for now.

Nevertheless, I'm finished with code cleanups and optimization of loading/saving speed.
