<!--exhibit:config=ex_pictorialis.cfg-->Ok, its finally there! Beautiful isn't it?I'm also planning to add filters to view only certain types of tasks. This could be useful, if we would like to provide a pop3 download dialog, showing the progress of all pop3 at once. This is comparable to Outlooks dialog or Evolutions progress dialog.
