Just posted a preliminary version of my <a href="https://github.com/fdietz/jwz_threading/tree">jwz threading library</a> on GitHub. Took me the whole day to get a first project including complete set of Rake tests up and running.

Since I'm still <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/08/gems-from-rubyforge-and-github">not sure if posting gems via GitHub is sufficient</a>, I've registered a new project on <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">RubyForge</a>. <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/04/08/git-for-rubyforge-accounts/">They now support Git</a> too, which makes it super easy to push my changes to both "hubs". So, you will most probably be able to download some ruby gems soon!

Now, that the setup phase is done I can concentrate on cleaning up my <a href="http://rspec.info/">specs</a> and getting the API design right.
