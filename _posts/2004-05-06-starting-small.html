<!--exhibit:config=ex_pictorialis.cfg-->Its raining outside, a good day to fix some smaller issues in Columba.

First of all I externalized all pending strings in the Account Dialog most notably the Spam Filter Options Panel, where I also fixed the layout.


Afterwards I've assigned every modal JDialog a correct parent JFrame, instead of just passing null. I hope this fixes the focus/window handling users noticed, as reported in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=866186&amp;group_id=21217&amp;atid=121217">bugtracker</a>.

Additionally, all plugins now compile cleanly. Use and the buid.xml script in the plugins directory to build all plugins. This script stops execution if a build fails. The buildall.sh shell script skips compile errors, so you can make sure that all working plugins compile.
