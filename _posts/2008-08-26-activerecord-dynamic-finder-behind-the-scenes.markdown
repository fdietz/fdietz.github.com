Wanted to finally post more about the dynamic finders, but then found [Jamis Buck'](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org)s blog entries which seems to be much better anyways than anything I would have been able to scribble down in my blog.[http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/11/20/under-the-hood-activerecord-base-find-part-2](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/11/20/under-the-hood-activerecord-base-find-part-2)[http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/12/1/under-the-hood-activerecord-base-find-part-3](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/12/1/under-the-hood-activerecord-base-find-part-3)Enjoy!
