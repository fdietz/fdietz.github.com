I've silently starting on hacking together a prototype for a jabber-based IM client. This is a pretty interesting technology I would love to see integrated in Columba in the future - meaning right after the 1.0 release this summer.

Think about receiving a message by your friend. An icon would immediately show his current online/offline/busy state and you can chat right away with him.

I'm still thinking about releasing this client as open-source in the future as stand-alone, but this dependents on user requests.
