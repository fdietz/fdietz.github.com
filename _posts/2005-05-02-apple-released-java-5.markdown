Unique features to this release for Mac OS X include:    * A new Cocoa Java Plugin API. The release notes say that this API can be used to embed Java into your Cocoa application.    * Support for the javax.print package    * and changes to the Java versioning mechanism    * Resolutions to a number of other issues in Hotspot, AWT, and other areas.For Columba, this means that we can finally start developing using some Java5 features!
