Hi developers,

I just wanted to let you know that Timo and me are going to work on
Columba again in April.

Almost all important tasks on our roadmap are finished. Build/Release
process is much easier now. So, hopefully we can do the RC3 release soon.

Additionally, I'm tinkering around with some CMS, so that the core team
can help us keeping our website up-to-date easily. This was way to complex
in the past.
