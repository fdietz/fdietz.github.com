<a href="http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/19934/">Fatten Up Your Java UIs with JGoodies</a>

First article I've seen covering JGoodies, a layout package. Karsten Lenz, author of JGoodies actually called me and asked to look into it a while ago, suggesting to use it in Columba.
Seems like its getting some more attention now. As for me, I can't live without it anymore.
