The #numbers are actually Feature Requests which can be found in our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=371217&amp;group_id=21217&amp;func=browse">tracker</a>. We try hard to start using this tool as an official feature plan for developers.  New developers should also look into our <a href="http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/UnassignedProgrammingTasks">wiki</a>.

What's most notably for developers is a much cleaner separation of mail and addressbook code, introducing an interface-only API. This way components can use each others functionality but can be compiled against the API safely.

Another bigger change is the removal of all interfaces like MainInterface, MailInterface and AddressbookInterface. We now use singleton classes instead which are instanciated lazy on demand. This makes things a lot easier because you don't have to manually assure that classes are instanciated in the correct order. This further simplifies writing testcases.

Also, we introduced a clean concept of a container which embeeds a component. This way you can switch between mail and addressbook components  in the same JFrame.
