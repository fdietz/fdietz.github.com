Just released ruby-config 0.7. Most interestingly I changed the user interface to be command based instead of using option switches. So, instead of:``ruby-config --list-installed`` you can do a simple:``ruby-config list``In case you missed the 0.6 release. Most noteworthy I fixed the chicken-egg problem where a newly installed Ruby runtime doesn't have the ruby-config gem installed yet. I've started maintaining [Release Notes](http://github.com/fdietz/ruby-config/blob/5a1a79284b24f63ef0fc07fb966eb07eab43f25e/ReleaseNotes.md) to make it more convenient to follow changes in the future.
