[freshmeat.net: Project Reviews - BitlBee: IRC vs. Instant Messengers](http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1088/)BitlBee apparently lets you talk with all your ICQ, Yahoo, etc. friends using you favourite IRC client. This is made possible by emulating an IRC server.Very cool idea, although it seems a bit complex to start with. Now, I'm probably able to use Jabber only for IM and IRC for all the people who still use some old proprietary IM protocol.Do you yahoo?
