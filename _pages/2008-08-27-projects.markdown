Columba is an Email Client written in [Java ](http://www.java.sun.com), featuring a user-friendly graphical interface with wizards and internationalization support.#### History
[Timo](http://timostich.de), a good friend of mine, I've meet at university, and me started this project in 2001. In the beginning our plan was to create a decent mail-client usuable for the two of us. But as we started to open our sourcecode for contributors it became much more.In 2005 Columba has been distributed together with OpenOffice and Firefox by the Indian IT ministry on several millions CDs (for example: [here](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39237340,00.htm), [here ](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39199972,00.htm)and [here](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39205447,00.htm)). Also, in Sept 2005 we have been [Slashdotted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect) and had an all time record of **3,233,231** hits on our website.<span style="line-height:normal;font-size:small;">Sourceforge Project Page: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/columba/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/columba/)</span>
