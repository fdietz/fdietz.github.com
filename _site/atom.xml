   <title>Team Dashboard supports Ganglia</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2012/08/09/team-dashboard-supports-ganglia.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Team Dashboard adds a Ganglia data source to show your system metrics as graph or counter widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get started you have to configure the URL to your Ganglia installation. The easiest way is to use the environment variable GANGLIA_URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
GANGLIA_URL=http://ganglia-host rails server
&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Team Dashboard HTTP Proxy support much cooler now</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2012/08/05/team-dashboard-http-proxy-much-cooler-now.html"/>

   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2012/08/05/team-dashboard-http-proxy-much-cooler-now</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Team Dashboard Number and Boolean Widgets support a HTTP Proxy data source already. Idea is to give it a URL of an existing JSON service which follows the format as specified in the documentation. It will then extract the current value from the JSON structure for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you have an existing service with a different structure? With the new version you can additionally set a value path using a dot notation to select a specific value in your JSON structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
{
  &quot;parent&quot; : {
    &quot;child&quot; : {
      &quot;child2&quot; : &quot;myValue&quot;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A value path of &quot;parent.child.child2&quot; would resolve &quot;myValue&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

Especially interesting to me are his concerns for Erlang's &quot;Open Source-ness&quot;. Remember how many problems the Java community had with similar problems? Or the benevolent dictatorship problems other projects have? It seems to help initially to get things rollin' but in later stages it becomes more and more of a problem. Let's see what's going to happen next!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why should I use ruby-config instead of ...</title>

   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/09/07/why-should-i-use-ruby-config-instead-of</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why should I use ruby-config instead of rvm? From what I can tell after examining their website is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/tree/master&quot;&gt;rvm&lt;/a&gt; works very similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/fdietz/ruby-config/tree/master&quot;&gt;ruby-config&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has the same basic feature set and works quite similar by changing symlinks and environment settings. It definitely looks more polished to me and has most probably seen more usage lately due to its recent popularity. BTW, I love their website design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what speaks for ruby-config? It is written in Ruby and has complete test coverage. It will probably attract the more ruby-oriented developer, since it has a low entry barrier for contributing back. Personally, I refrain from maintaining large bash scripts, having them replaced several years ago with Perl scripts, which I replaced later on happily with Ruby. No pun intended ;-) And I simply enjoy working with Ruby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy competition is good in my opinion. I'll get in touch with rvm's maintainer to see where both projects strengths are and how we can both improve our projects by learning from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just released ruby-config 0.7. Most interestingly I changed the user interface to be command based instead of using option switches. So, instead of:&lt;code&gt;ruby-config --list-installed&lt;/code&gt; you can do a simple:&lt;code&gt;ruby-config list&lt;/code&gt;In case you missed the 0.6 release. Most noteworthy I fixed the chicken-egg problem where a newly installed Ruby runtime doesn't have the ruby-config gem installed yet. I've started maintaining &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/fdietz/ruby-config/blob/5a1a79284b24f63ef0fc07fb966eb07eab43f25e/ReleaseNotes.md&quot;&gt;Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; to make it more convenient to follow changes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using jeweler for ruby-config</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/08/29/using-jeweler-for-ruby-config.html"/>
   <updated>2009-08-29T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/08/29/using-jeweler-for-ruby-config</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/tree/master&quot;&gt;jeweler&lt;/a&gt; for ruby-config and am very surprised how smooth everything went. What I especially like about jeweler is that its absolutely a no-brainer to create gems and post them via github. And with the versioning support its a joy to push out new releases! Am probably going to move over my hoe based projects to jeweler now.So, in order to get started with jeweler you have to install the jeweler gem first:&lt;code&gt;gem install technicalpickles-jeweler&lt;/code&gt;Next to bootstrap a new project you do:&lt;code&gt;jeweler --create-repo --summary &quot;Ruby-Config&quot; ruby-config&lt;/code&gt;This will create a project skeleton with all the usual candidates. What's left to do now is edit the Rakefile to setup the gem configuration and adding some sourcecode. Don't forget the tests!Now, you simply create an initial version with:&lt;code&gt;rake version:write MAJOR=0 MINOR=1 PATCH=0&lt;/code&gt;which update the VERSION file in your project for you.When you do a &quot;rake release&quot;, jeweler will create a new gemspec file for you, commit and push the update, create a version tag and push it, too.When simply updating a minor feature, I do a &quot;rake version:bump:minor&quot; and afterwards a &quot;rake release&quot; and I'm done. Great stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have been doing some more work on ruby-config again.

Again, this is done really unobtrusive. First, the task shows you what changes it wants to do, then it prompts you for a yes or no. You can always cancel and apply the changes manually.I've generated a new gem spec with version 0.5. So, please upgrade!&lt;/p&gt;

Took me the whole day to get a first project including complete set of Rake tests up and running.Since I'm still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/08/gems-from-rubyforge-and-github&quot;&gt;not sure if posting gems via GitHub is sufficient&lt;/a&gt;, I've registered a new project on &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;RubyForge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/04/08/git-for-rubyforge-accounts/&quot;&gt;They now support Git&lt;/a&gt; too, which makes it super easy to push my changes to both &quot;hubs&quot;. So, you will most probably be able to download some ruby gems soon!Now, that the setup phase is done I can concentrate on cleaning up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspec.info/&quot;&gt;specs&lt;/a&gt; and getting the API design right.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just saw an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/articles/ruby-open-classes-monkeypatching&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; related to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fdietz.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/symbolto_proc-what/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; about Symbol#to_proc. Very interesting read! And even more fun is this article which explains the same mechanism and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/to_proc-currying-ruby19&quot;&gt;currying&lt;/a&gt; on top:[sourcecode language=&quot;ruby&quot;]proc {|x, y, z| x + y + z }.curry[/sourcecode]returns the equivalent of:[sourcecode language=&quot;ruby&quot;]proc {|x| proc {|y| proc {|z| x + y + z } } }[/sourcecode]Here's the example:[sourcecode language=&quot;ruby&quot;]plus_five = proc { |x,y,z| x + y + z }.curry.call(2).call(3)plus_five[10]  #=&gt; 15[/sourcecode]I've seen something similar in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;. A good explanation of Scala function currying can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/function-currying-in-scala&quot;&gt;Daniel Spiewak's blog&lt;/a&gt;. BTW, Scala finally got a new website! And even better: Just got an E-Mail from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artima.com/&quot;&gt;Artima.com&lt;/a&gt; that the 4th edition of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala&quot;&gt;Programming in Scala&lt;/a&gt;&quot; arrived. Something to read for the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Symbol#to_proc - what?</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/08/12/symbolto_proc-what.html"/>
   <updated>2008-08-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/08/12/symbolto_proc-what</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Rails-Brad-Ediger/dp/0596510322/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_a&quot;&gt;Advanced Rails&lt;/a&gt; by Brad Ediger, I've stumbled upon this little helper in ActiveSupport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The to_proc method is an extension to Symbol. Let me shamelessly copy Brad's example here:
(1..5).map { |i| i.to_s } # =&gt; [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is already pretty nice, but now look what happens when using Symbol#to_proc:
(1..5).map(&amp;amp;:to_s) # =&gt; [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is even shorter and does produce exactly the same output. So what happened here? The &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; character tells Ruby that you want to call map with &quot;to_s&quot; as a block argument. It will force Ruby to call the Symbol's to_proc method. The method will create a Proc and send the symbol to the object calling the to_proc method. And this leads to iterating over the numbers specified by the range and then calling the block, passing in the numbers and converting them to strings. Okay...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a typical example of me not being able to figure out what some code actually means and then by accident finding the explanation somewhere else. How the heck am I supposed to know where to find the documentation to such a cool extensions? I will let you know when I'm finally able to solve this mystery...&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Migrations and Foreign Key Handling</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/08/03/migrations-and-foreign-key-handling.html"/>
   <updated>2008-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/08/03/migrations-and-foreign-key-handling</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A question which came up real quick was how to add a foreign key to your migrations. In my example rails app I'm using a project with a has_many association to tasks, like this:[sourcecode language='ruby']class Project &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base  has_many :tasksendclass Task &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :projectend[/sourcecode]Now I want my task database to look like the following:&lt;pre&gt;mysql&amp;gt; describe tasks;+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default |+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+| id         | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    || title      | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    || body       | text         | YES  |     | NULL    || status     | tinyint(1)   | YES  |     | NULL    || created_at | datetime     | YES  |     | NULL    || updated_at | datetime     | YES  |     | NULL    || project_id | int(11)      | NO   | MUL | NULL    |+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+7 rows in set (0.00 sec)&lt;/pre&gt;Note, that I've removed the last &quot;extra&quot; column which is usually shown by the MySQL describe command. It only shows the auto_increment for the primary key but it would have overlapped my fixed-width wordpress theme.First we have to create a new migration for adding a new column using:&lt;pre&gt;script/generate migration add_project_column&lt;/pre&gt;This will generate an initial ruby file where I only added the two lines to add and delete a column.[sourcecode language='ruby']class AddProjectColumn &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration  def self.up    add_column :tasks, :project_id, :integer, :null =&gt; false  end  def self.down    delete_column :tasks, :project_id  endend[/sourcecode]Next step is the foreign key which we can put directly in the migration, like this:[sourcecode language='ruby']class AddProjectColumn &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Migration  def self.up    add_column :tasks, :project_id, :integer, :null =&gt; false    execute 'ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tasks_projects FOREIGN KEY ( project_id ) references projects( id )'  end  def self.down    delete_column :tasks, :project_id    execute 'ALTER TABLE tasks DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_tasks_projects'  endend[/sourcecode]Note, that I'm actually executing a MySQL command to add a foreign key. So, this code most probably won't work when used with different databases.For now this is good enough, but I should probably look into refactoring these two lines by extracting them into a migration helper class. This way it will be easier to modify in a single central place in case the database will be changed.I'm still searching for database independent foreign key management handled in migrations. So, please let me know if you find a better way to do this! Until then some more &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UsingMigrations&quot;&gt;readings&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ActiveRecord dynamic attribute-based finders</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/08/03/activerecord-dynamic-attribute-based-finders.html"/>
   <updated>2008-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/08/03/activerecord-dynamic-attribute-based-finders</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm more used to Java ORM frameworks as for example JPA and Hibernate but started to play around with ActiveRecord lately. Probably all has been said already and I will spare you the introduction and point you to some &lt;a href=&quot;http://rails-doc.org/rails/ActiveRecord/Base&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; instead. It took me some time to realize that there is much more than what is shown mostly in online articles, blog postings and books. Let's start with the typical example of a book model containing articles defined with a simple has_many relation.[sourcecode language='ruby']class Book &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base  has_many :chaptersendclass Chapter &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :bookend[/sourcecode]A typical query for all books would then look like this:[sourcecode language='ruby']Book.find(:all)[/sourcecode]and a query for all published books would be something similar to:[sourcecode language='ruby']Book.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [ 'status = ?', false])[/sourcecode]Now to simplify this we can instead use the dynamic finder:[sourcecode language='ruby']Book.find_all_by_status(false)[/sourcecode]Until now this is pretty straightforward, but now comes the interesting part. Imagine now that you have got a book and you want to retrieve a list of chapters:[sourcecode language='ruby']@book = Book.find(params[:id])@chapters = @book.chapters.find_all_by_title(title)[/sourcecode]Notice how one can use the same dynamic finders directly on the child association? Much easier than making a query using the book_id foreign key in the chapters table! In fact, ActiveRecord automatically makes the class-level methods of the Chapter model available directly for the associations. This also works in case you have added your own finder methods in the model.[sourcecode language='ruby']class Chapter &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :book  def self.find_finished    Chapter.find_all_by_status(false)  endend[/sourcecode]Note, the &quot;self&quot; since we are adding a class-level method to Chapter. ActiveRecord will automatically make this now available in the association:[sourcecode language='ruby']@chapters = @book.chapters.find_finished[/sourcecode]Hope you got the idea. It simply is beautiful. Next time we should probably look into what's behind the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rails-doc.org/rails/ActiveRecord/Base/find/class&quot;&gt;dynamic finder method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apple Leopard Tech Talk in Düsseldorf, Germany</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2007/12/02/apple-leopard-tech-talk-in-dusseldorf-germany.html"/>
   <updated>2007-12-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2007/12/02/apple-leopard-tech-talk-in-dusseldorf-germany</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/events/techtalks/europe.html&quot;&gt;Leopard Tech Talk&lt;/a&gt; last week in Düsseldorf. The tech talks are a great opportunity to meet other Mac developers face-to-face. Apple experts gave presentations about the latest Leopard development.  I'm not really counting me in as a Mac developer, as I was always more of a Java Swing guy. But the Mac OS X as a development platform and especially its aesthetics are quite appealing to me and were always and inspiration. The latest &quot;official &quot;support for Ruby, specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyosa.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;RubyOSA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Ruby Cocoa&lt;/a&gt;, make things even more interesting.But, lets come to more interesting things. You've probably all read about those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ical/&quot;&gt;300+ new Leopard&lt;/a&gt; features ;-) So, I'm not going to list them all here for you again. I only sum up the little niceties which you probably won't have read that often... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Resolution Independence&lt;/span&gt; was the first topic. This gets more and more important as people's displays become bigger. I run a 20&quot; wide screen, so no problem here yet. You can actually play around with the DPI numbers with the Quartz Debug tool, located in &quot;Developer Applications-&amp;gt; Graphics Tools&quot;. Most application look pretty good already, expect funnily the Finder which is still pretty much thinking in pixels here. &lt;br /&gt;Next came&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Spotlight&lt;/span&gt;, which not only lets you search for menu items out-of-the-box, but also lets you index your whole user interfaces. Think of a completed configuration dialog where it might help to search for a specific option. If you are a Java Developer for yourself, you most probably used the search box in the Eclipse Preferences Dialog... Only thing you have to do to activate this is to tell xcode to index your user interface. Oh and by the way - it seems that Spotlight might be able to also search os servers in the future and not only on your local hard drive. Something else I didn't know is that Spotlight is most importantly an API which can be used inside your application, too. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;Then we have of course the &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;64 bit support in Leopard&lt;/span&gt; now in much more places, even in Java 6 which is hopefully shipping soon. Nobody knows when and why it takes that long, but we'll see. No reason yet to panic and sell my Macbook Pro &lt;em&gt;hehe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Core Animation Library&lt;/span&gt; was next and this one is actually funny as it wasn't development for Leopard specifically, but first appeared somewhere else. Rumor's tell it was the iPhone. That reminds me that I should look into Chet Haase's &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.java.net/blog/chet/archive/2007/10/move_it.html&quot;&gt;Animation and Transition Library&lt;/a&gt;, after reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132413930?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=filriccli-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0132413930&quot;&gt;Filthy Rich Clients&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;Next was &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Time Machine&lt;/span&gt;. I didn't know that one can actually restore a complete system by using the Migration Assistant which comes with the Leopard Installer. Still, haven't got the time yet to buy me a new external hard drive. Also very cool is that Spotlight is Time Machine aware and can actually show several older revisions as search result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt; Automator&lt;/span&gt; has gotten some new flow controls and rules. Additionally, a cool virtual user recording lets you basically record macros. Lets see if this works as good as in Photoshop. Did I mention the AppleScript bridges for Python and Ruby yet?&lt;br /&gt;Then comes of course &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Objective-C 2.0&lt;/span&gt;, which now supports Garbage Collection which the Apple engineers have been tinkering about for a dozen years but now seem to have found a way to make this work really well. Appearantly, they managed the generational (incremental) Garbage Collector to run faster then the manual retain and release. Then also very nice is the properties support, which has been discussed in length for Java, too. They use an easy dot notation as almost everyone else. Exceptions have been optimized, now the throwing is expense but the try is cheap. In older versions it was the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I found very interesting was the Image related libraries including &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Image I/O&lt;/span&gt; for reading and writing various file formats and metadata including RAW formats and high dynamic range support. Then &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;ImageKit&lt;/span&gt; which offers some nice of the self components to find, browse, display and edit images. And last but not least the &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Core Imag&lt;/span&gt;e, which is actually using the GPU for all its image processing - thing OpenGL. It offers more than 100 common image processing filters, basically the usual candidates you wouldn't want to miss in Photoshop.&lt;br /&gt;That's it for today. On a last note, the food was excellent ;-) and the Mac crowd quite friendly with more than 200 visitors. I'm off for today, heading to Frankfurt, Germany tomorrow for the Java Tech Days! Meet you there. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>EasyMock IllegalStateException</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2007/10/05/easymock-love.html"/>
   <updated>2007-10-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2007/10/05/easymock-love</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.easymock.org/&quot;&gt;EasyMock &lt;/a&gt;last year and since then it has become an integral part of my development toolset. I especially love the Java 5 syntax and how self-explaining tests with mock objects are.But today I stumpled over my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.easymock.org/&quot;&gt;EasyMock &lt;/a&gt;exception which kept me pondering for an hour until I found the solution in another &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcels-javanotes.blogspot.com/2007/03/easymock-and-illegalstateexception.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.  The problem was that I was calling a method with an Array of Objects as input parameters.This caused problems because equals of the array failed as expected, but a solution was nicely explained in the docs. Simply use &lt;strong&gt;aryEq()&lt;/strong&gt; method, which does the equality check for the objects in the array. Very nice! But, then the &lt;strong&gt;IllegalStateException &lt;/strong&gt;caught me. It complained that two matchers were found, but only one recorded. The solution is simple but not really intuitive. Once you starting using matchers you have to use matchers for all arguments of a method call.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been working or better playing around with Columba the better half of my student years. Especially the latest release was quite difficult to manage. RL (aka real life) kept me quite busy and is also the reason why I now finally decided to stop developing on Columba.
I had so much fun meeting and working with all different kinds of people from throughout the world. Thank you all for your support!It was not quite the ride we planned. Thinking about it - we never really planned anything ;-) But, that's probably the reason why it was so much fun!As Timo and me are now both not able to contribute any more, I hope that someone is interested in taking over from here. Java and especially Desktop Java is becoming more and more interesting. If so drop me an &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:fdietz@gmail.com&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, please!Whoever wants to stay in touch - I've got some good news. I've reactivated my blog again!

   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2007/01/01/happy-new-year</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hope everyone out there had a &quot;Guten Rutsch&quot; which is a German term describing the transition from the old into the new year - need something for my headache before I can go on!Its been awhile since I wrote in my blog. First of all you might have noticed the changes in my address. Yes, its not &quot;.de&quot; anymore - its now &quot;.name&quot;. My old domain was hijacked!  You might ask how this can happen, but its pretty simple actually. I had my nice blog, website and email server running hosted by some company and wanted to move all my stuff to a new host. Thing is you have to change the domain to point to the new address. Usually the old host sends you a note that the domain is free again and with that note you can go to the new host. Very simple process! But, in my case something went wrong in the middle, I did receive the note too late, someone else already took it :-( I refuse to pay a whole lot of my money for a domain, which was only bought by that individual to make me buy it back!In case you send me emails to my mail@frederikdietz.de account, you didn't even get any notifications or bounce messages. I guess, I lost quite a few messages from people who have most probably know idea about my problems. So, in case you send me an email and have not received an answer yet, try mail@frederikdietz.name, please.The &lt;a href=&quot;http://columbamail.org&quot;&gt;Columba&lt;/a&gt; Development &lt;a href=&quot;http://columbamail.org/drupal/?q=blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt; is still on the main website. I will try to reference back and forth to not confuse people, if there's something relevant.A lot of things happenend in the Java Realm. We have a very nice Java6 Release out of  the door, Java is going to be Open Source... Who would have thought that 5 years ago! So, there will be still quite a lot of Java related topics here, also Enterprise Java as this is my daily job, but still Swing will not be forgotten ;-)Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just commited an updated Eclipse &lt;strong&gt;.project&lt;/strong&gt; file to CVS.  Every plugin and necessary libraries are now added to the project build settings. This way, doing refactoring in core, the changes will automatically propagate. Or at least, they are marked as bugs ;-) This was way to much work in the past.Nevertheless, Columba will not use the class files compiled by Eclipse to load the plugins. Instead it will always use the &lt;strong&gt;plugin.jar&lt;/strong&gt;. So, you have to run &quot;&lt;code&gt;ant plugins&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and compile all of them to see the changes.I really like this behaviour, but we could also change it. For example, always trying to load the class files from Columba's classpath first would be an option.&lt;/p&gt;

All these methods didn't use &lt;strong&gt;InputStream &lt;/strong&gt;as the parameter to pass resource file content. Instead they used the path to the resource as String. This is wrong from an API user's point of view, because the internal loader doesn't know where these resources come from. You might even want to load resources from a webserver. So, simply using &lt;strong&gt;InputStream &lt;/strong&gt;makes the API much more decoupled from the internal implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just read a user's complain about Columba following &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/&quot;&gt;Gnome User Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. These guidelines also dictact how to layout the menus. For example: the &lt;strong&gt;Preferences &lt;/strong&gt;menuitem should always be the last item in the &lt;strong&gt;Edit &lt;/strong&gt;menu. At least in Gnome. On Windows it should be better placed in &lt;strong&gt;Utilities&lt;/strong&gt;.I actually just saw that in Firefox. They change their menu based on the platform. So, they are more strictly following the platform they are just running on. Whereas we aim to provide the same experience for user's on all platforms.And my feeling is that we do right so. Many of our users choose Columba, because its written in Java, and because you can use it on every operating system and even reuse one single configuration folder. These users would be really upset, if the menu layout would change everytime they switch the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,we finally released 1.0 RC3!I'd like to thank especially, Mark for tracking down sooo many bugs and Timo for not getting tired to fix all of them...Personally for me and I know for Timo, too, this was a very hard release. Timo just moved to Saarbrücken and is doing his Ph.D. in Computer Science, I started work at SAP Germany. We both had almost no spare time to work on Columba. Nevertheless, I'm really proud of this new release. It has a couple of very interesting new features, &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of code/design cleanups and dozens of bugfixes.Last month alone, we had almost 300.000 web hits on our new website. Columba's is a great success in India where it is shipped alongside OpenOffice and Mozilla Firefox. And still, my feeling is that its going to become even more exciting.As you might have heard already, this is our last release candidate before the final 1.0 release, which is about to happen in 4-6 weeks. So, stay tuned, help us tracking down the remaining problems and download the new version&lt;img src=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=18&amp;amp;Itemid=84&quot; alt=&quot;Download&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=139&amp;amp;Itemid=2&quot;&gt;Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;Have fun,-Frederik&lt;/p&gt;

And we are convinced that the time is right for Java-based desktop software. We are not a company, selling some product!To circumvent such confusion in the future, I've added a prominent PayPal donation button on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;front page&lt;/a&gt; and also a page &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=138&amp;amp;Itemid=105&quot;&gt;dedicated to this matter&lt;/a&gt;.

Content repositories extend databases with such additional capabilities. The Java Content Repository API (JSR 170) defines a standard to access content repositories from Java code, and promises to greatly simplify Java database programming.

Usually, we have a simply model for the data and use updateComponents(boolean), method to pass the data from the model to the view and back.I definitly will take the time to evaluate the further application of Karsten's Binding Framework.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our bug day didn't went out as good as expected. Sadly, we didn't get a great number of testers. Nevertheless, we were able to solve a couple of very critical problems and finished many features.Most notably Timo integrated JDIC (&lt;a href=&quot;https://jdic.dev.java.net/&quot;&gt;https://jdic.dev.java.net/&lt;/a&gt;) for the trayicon support and opening attachments with the system's default applications. Also, the cleaned up message viewer component is now capable of viewing attachment's contents inline.So, all in all we are really satisfied with the work done and are much closer now to a RC3 release. We are probably doing another test release next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all there's the new filter toolbar. Note, that we now offer complete search functionality inclusive full body search, etc. This is possible because we don't rely on the Table Model anymore. Instead we use the vFolder search functionality. This way your search is automatically saved as a child vFolder of the &quot;Search Results&quot; folder.And then the &quot;view attachment's contents inline&quot; message preview component. This is of course an optional feature. What you actually see here is a message which contains another message as attachment. This is a pretty common case, when forward a message as attachment, which is the default in most email clients today. This also works when using text or image attachments, which looks really sexy :-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did some prototyping on the weekend and integrated BerkleyDB in Columba as general core service. Additionally, I've added a header-cache implementation which makes use of it.Sadly there are still a couple of smaller issues/annoyances left. I therefore dropped this &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap&quot;&gt;RoadMap&lt;/a&gt; item for now.Nevertheless, I'm finished with code cleanups and optimization of loading/saving speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm currently commiting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groovy.codehaus.org&quot;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; language support. A Groovy Interpreter plugin contains all the necessary libraries. It therefore has to be installed first, on order to start writing Groovy plugins. I've also added a simply Hello World Groovy action plugin to demonstrate how to write plugins with Groovy.Note, that have to use the current CVS version, the plugins won't work with RC2.Following the Groovy code which opens a swing dialog:&lt;code&gt;public class HelloWorldAction extends AbstractColumbaAction {public HelloWorldAction(FrameMediator controller) {super(controller, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)putValue(AbstractColumbaAction.SHORT_DESCRIPTION,                                 &quot;Show me this tooltip, please&quot;)}public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Hello World!&quot;)}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--exhibit:config=ex_pictorialis.cfg--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The RC2 release contains the new Mozilla Mail compatible commandline options which makes integration with third-party software much easier. Most notably OpenOffice, which is the main reason why we changed this. See the screenshot on how to configure your OpenOffice to directly send messages with attached documents. Note, that you can either choose Option1 or Option2.&lt;/p&gt;

One idea by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/threads.html&quot;&gt;ibm research&lt;/a&gt;  came to our mind.  Timo already implemented an arc-viewer control, so we would be able to play around with this thing after the RC2 release.Maybe, this way we could get rid of the current JTreeTable message-list and replace it with something more generic. The threaded-view capabilities make this old control a pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What happens after the RC2 release</title>

   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2004/12/02/what-happens-after-the-rc2-release</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm currently discussing things with Timo as we come closer to a final 1.0 release of Columba. First of all there will be another release candidate RC3. This is necessary in our opinion to fix a couple of micro design issues in Columba. Note, that we focus on stuff which could further lead to more work in the future. We fix stuff for the 1.0 release, so that we can add new features afterwards easily. We will get much more attention and users after the stable 1.0 release. So, we don't want to stop contributors adding new stuff, because of problems in our code.Our current planning includes a cleanup of the message viewer component and the message list. Both should be much more generic in our opinion.  For example the message list knows about the fact that it displays email message headers, this way we can't reuse big parts of this swing component.&lt;!--exhibit:config=ex_pictorialis.cfg--&gt;Also on our list is a more generic approach of using the Filters and Filter Actions including the Filter Toolbar and Search Dialog. We would like to move some of the code in the core framework. It currently is a mail-component specific feature. But we want to reuse this code in the addressbook component, too.I'm going to kickstart further discussions in the developer mailinglist. We should really try hard to stay focused on our goals of a quick final 1.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;

This currently includes trayicon support with a popup menu and lookup for an appropriate application for the specific mimetype. We also consider to use a better html-viewer instead of the built-in swing JTextPane. But we have to discuss this problem more thoroughly.We will therefore remove the jniwrapper based trayicon support.  Nevertheless, jniwrapper will be useful for us. Most probably for Message and Contact import filters and mime contents viewers using win32 applications integrated in the message viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2004/11/29/interesting-new-stuff-in-upcoming-rc2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;New Features:- international IMAP mailbox naming using UTF-7 encoding/decoding (tstich)
- added show next/previous message and unread message actions (fdietz)
- #999257, show/hide message preview panel (fdietz)
- offer three choices for viewing email headers: default, custom, all (fdietz)
- #999871, &quot;subject or sender contains&quot; should do filtering on typing (fdietz)
- show recent message count in folder tree using blue font (fdietz)
- #999748, in preview panel,full emailadress should be displayed beside (fdietz)
- added complete sorting and filtering support for contact JTable (fdietz)
- speedup of IMAP mailbox selection and auto-checking (tstich)
- set Columba to default-email client on win32 using jniwrapper (tstich)
- added jpim library for vCard import/export, not complete yet (fdietz)
The #numbers are actually Feature Requests which can be found in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=371217&amp;amp;group_id=21217&amp;amp;func=browse&quot;&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt;. We try hard to start using this tool as an official feature plan for developers.  New developers should also look into our &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/UnassignedProgrammingTasks&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.What's most notably for developers is a much cleaner separation of mail and addressbook code, introducing an interface-only API. This way components can use each others functionality but can be compiled against the API safely.Another bigger change is the removal of all interfaces like MainInterface, MailInterface and AddressbookInterface. We now use singleton classes instead which are instanciated lazy on demand. This makes things a lot easier because you don't have to manually assure that classes are instanciated in the correct order. This further simplifies writing testcases.Also, we introduced a clean concept of a container which embeeds a component. This way you can switch between mail and addressbook components  in the same JFrame.&lt;/p&gt;

This library makes it very easy for Java programs to access win32 functionality.I've started with adding trayicon support. So, you can see Columba's program icon in the traybar on Windows. A context-menu giving you some options. I'm planning to add message notification and all this useful stuff later.Hopefully, we will see more use of this library. Things on my mind are for example, better usage of the windows mimetypes (Giat Hana showed interest here), access to the windows registry to automatically detect external tools, import for Outlook messages and contacts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Erik did post a couple of interesting bugs or ui issues. Following have been fixed until now:-  #952189, added dialog to prompt user to save his work in composer, using windowClosing event here
-  #952173 changed default column width.
-  #951531, added decoding of headerfield
-   #951518, use dialog data, instead of config data to checkout supported authentication mechanism
-  #951522 fixed initial selection of folder selection dialog
-  #951528, newly created folders are now selected as expected
-  #952164 signature file defaults to signature.txt which should be more familiar for windows users
-  #952184, creating virtual folder sets parent correctly now. additionally the search dialog is opened immediately
-   #953239 fixed nullpointer exception when searching IMAP folders
Nevertheless, there are still a couple of more critical bugs open. So, I guess the next testing release will be a few days later than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

So, this is the first hurdle for releasing Columba.I've got Timo to fix an annoying SMTP open connection bug, caused by to strict assumptions of &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/subprojects_ristretto.php&quot;&gt;Ristretto.&lt;/a&gt; Should now work much better with servers which aren't strictly RFC-compliant.Forwarding messages works correctly again, too. An inputstream was accidently closed too early.Also gone through the README, COMPILE and CHANGES docs and brought them up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've finally finished my exams and thesis paper. So, starting with todayI'm back developing on Columba againFirst of all the roadmap at &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap&quot;&gt;http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;is slightly outdated. I'm going to update the items list this week. The M3 releaseis going to happen at Mai the 30th. Furthermore, I'm planning to dotesting releases on Mai the 8th and Mai the 16th.This is the last Milestone release, which should be much more stable andpolished as compared to M2, which sadly contained a couple of veryannoying bugs. The testing releases, the new testcases and a soon to beupdated Smoketest (&lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Smoketest&quot;&gt;http://columba.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/Smoketest&lt;/a&gt;)will ensure this.Last Milestone also means, last version with new major features. This isthe reason why I would like to call it v1.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1), insteadof Milestone M3. Afterwards only RC will be released until Columba is stableenough for a final 1.0 version. This also includes user/developer documentation.My feeling is that this will happen around 2 months later.I know that many people would like to see much more new features in Columba,including changing it into a complete Groupware solution comparable to MS Outlookand other apps.Timo and me concluded a while ago that the best for Columba will be to get astable release out of the door as fast as possible. With such a stable version,it will be very easy to add additional features or even concentrate more ona complete collaboration tool. Users will most likely do without a missing feature,but they won't use beta software.Considering the latest discussions (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html&quot;&gt;http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html)&lt;/a&gt;)about creating open-source software with good user interfaces, robustness andcomplete documentation my feeling is that this is a very reasonable plan.So, stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;!--exhibit:config=ex_pictorialis.cfg--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Its raining outside, a good day to fix some smaller issues in Columba.First of all I externalized all pending strings in the Account Dialog most notably the Spam Filter Options Panel, where I also fixed the layout.Afterwards I've assigned every modal JDialog a correct parent JFrame, instead of just passing null. I hope this fixes the focus/window handling users noticed, as reported in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;amp;aid=866186&amp;amp;group_id=21217&amp;amp;atid=121217&quot;&gt;bugtracker&lt;/a&gt;.Additionally, all plugins now compile cleanly. Use and the buid.xml script in the plugins directory to build all plugins. This script stops execution if a build fails. The buildall.sh shell script skips compile errors, so you can make sure that all working plugins compile.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spam fine tuning</title>
   <link href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2004/03/19/spam-fine-tuning.html"/>
   <updated>2004-03-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2004/03/19/spam-fine-tuning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Waking up this morning I recognized that I've forgotten something really important for the token database.I'm using MD5 sums to detect already learned messages. These shouldn't be added to the token database twice or more times - just once. When marking messages as spam, which are non spam, Columba should use this MD5 sum to correct the value, if the user marks the message as non spam.You can imagine that this MD5 message list is getting hugh over time. So, I've added a timestamp for every MD5 sum. This way, cleaning up the token database is very easy because I can just remove old messages.Sadly, this means that the spam.db file format has changed a bit.Another new thing are handcrafted rules. This is pretty new, I've got it from a paper &quot;A bayesian approach to filtering junk email&quot; from Sahami et. al.In Columba I've basically eliminated the need for something like a training mode with these rules. The idea is pretty easy. The bayesian classifier enables us to add handcrafted rules, which are handled equally to other tokens. So, a rule just adds another probability additionally to the word probabilities.When starting from scratch you don't have any words in your token database. The spam engine can't detect spam messages until you trained it for some time. But the handcrafted rules are in place, giving you a good start to determine spam messages, until you have collected enough tokens using the message contents.One such rule would be for example checking if the Subject is of capital letters only, or if the Subject contains many whitespaces. You can think if many more rules. Spamassassin has a very big list of rules which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spamassassin.org/tests.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.   Adding new rules is very easy. Just subclass AbstractRule in org.columba.mail.spam.rules.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2004/03/19/silently-added-more-filters</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've added two more filters. The first one is a &quot;match all&quot; filter, which just matches all messages. Very handy if you want to apply filters on all messages to cleanup your inbox or doing other repeating stuff.This will become even more useful, when the &quot;automatically apply filter on new messages&quot; option is added on a per-folder basis. This way, you can apply filters on newly added messages. This is something many people want. Just drop a message into a folder, execute the filter and process the message data.The other filter checks if the sender already exists in your addressbook. This is currently used in the spam filter anyway, to achieve an automatic whitelisting.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Checking the latest CVS sources from &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sf.net&quot;&gt;Columba&lt;/a&gt; you will notice the new integrated spam solution. This work is based on my bachelor dissertation. An introduction can be read at &lt;a href=&quot;http://frederikdietz.de/jbayesian.php&quot;&gt;http://frederikdietz.de&lt;/a&gt;. The thesis paper can be downloaded as &lt;a href=&quot;http://frederikdietz.de/files/thesis.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf file&lt;/a&gt;.The spam filter can be enabled in the account configuration. Note, that it takes some time to train this filter. This is done in marking messages as spam or not spam.In the first few days its recommended to just mark the messages as spam. Do not make them move to trash automatically, as its high likely that you will get some false-positives. Also, use the addressbook checking option, which prevents marking messages as spam from people which are already in your addressbook.Its recommended to delete:&lt;pre&gt;[your-config-folder]/mail/main_toolbar.xml&lt;/pre&gt;This will create a new toolbar for you, with a mark message as spam button added.In my personal experience, learning around 1000 messages should be enough to make it perform well.There's going to be some more fine-tuning needed, especially to make it perform better in the beginning - you have been warned!So, please help me test this beast ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

An icon would immediately show his current online/offline/busy state and you can chat right away with him.I'm still thinking about releasing this client as open-source in the future as stand-alone, but this dependents on user requests.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2004/03/08/folder-and-filter-testsuite-complete</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My exams currently keep me pretty busy until next week. Right now, I'm totally into DB2 - the second lecture on database, not IBM's database - focusing on Object-Oriented and XML databases. Not very exciting, though...So, finally some news on Columba development. After starting a bigger refactoring of the folder packages in the mail module, I've finished with a testsuite for all types of folders. You can add every foldertype you want and the testcases run over it showing you problems. This should become pretty handy when adding new folders, including new local mailbox formats or even database backed folder implementations.The Filter testsuite covers all plugin-based filters which are shipped by default with Columba. This is more important than you would actually think because these are also the default fallbacks, used in case a search-engine doesn't implement all operations. So, implementors of search-engines can just start hacking on their search-engine adding more optimized operations, and falling back to the default engine in case.&lt;/p&gt;

Why did Sun regret to join the Eclipse Consortium? This way they could start to influence this Consortium, instead of just blaming Eclipse to divide the Java tools world.  Or they could probably think about making Netbeans use the Eclipse plugins and vice versa.&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;Did you know that they have James Gosling again as head of their development tools divison?&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2008-7345-5148588.html?tag=nefd_gutspro&quot;&gt;http://news.com.com/2008-7345-5148588.html?tag=nefd_gutspro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Several people have described MUTE as the &quot;third generation file sharing network&quot; (From Napster to Gnutella to MUTE, with each generation getting less centralized and more anonymous). MUTE uses algorithms inspired by ant behavior to route all messages, include file transfers, through a mesh network of neighbor connections.Does anyone actually use this? Sounds interesting though...&lt;/p&gt;

But hey, Microsoft was always very good in making things easy and transparent for users. So, my feeling is that we just have to trust them here...Of course, instead you can also just stop using IE and download &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; instead. In fact, I'm writing this entry in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Firebird&lt;/a&gt;. It just took me too long to fire up my JScript to check if my blog is not spoofing me in any way.Don't forget to send Microsoft a message making them switch their website to a secure SSL/TLS thingy. This would at least provide us with a secure connection to their knowledge-base ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I'm currently working on finishing my dissertation, I stumpled upon some very interesting spam message recently.I'm writing about macchiato, a spam filter library, written in Java, where I'm using a naive bayesian filter to detect spam. Its an adaptive filter which gets trained by the user's messages. As I'm close to finish this thing, I had to draw a line where I won't go further optimizing the library - at least as part of my dissertation. Development will of course continue - Milestone M3 of &lt;a href=&quot;http://columba.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;Columba&lt;/a&gt; will have this integrated.Now to my recent discoveries in the faszinating world of penis enlargements, horny women and nigerian millionars...Most spam message tend to be written using HTML. Now take a look at the word Free in html:&lt;code&gt;Fr&amp;amp;lt;font size=0&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;#38nbsp;&amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;gt;ee&lt;/code&gt;Did you see the trick? &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp;#38nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt; is actually just a space, but it has a zero font size, so it looks correct to the user, but my text tokenizer won't recognize this word. It will recognize &lt;strong&gt;Fr&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ee&lt;/strong&gt; as independent tokens, though. Which makes no sense :-(I'll have to further improve the message tokenizer to be more aware of html than it is currently.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, development on Columba is non-functional for more than 2 weeks now. This is due ongoing problems with Sourceforge's CVS servers. I surely see that they had to do some updating and I don't want to complain about a free service, either. But they should at least try to do better on communication. I'm really starting to feel kind a dump, getting asked for a dozen times now, what OS, what CVS client, which SSH version, etc. I'm running. I really tried to help them track down the problem but they just seem to be too busy fixing their problems.I've proposed a move to another host, most probably to &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.net&quot;&gt;java.net&lt;/a&gt;. Note, that I'm talking about CVS only. Everything else will stay on sourceforge. We'll see what others have to say.My feeling is that sf is just not scaling anymore that easily, given that they host about 70.000 projects - an incredible number. So, maybe its about time to change our host. Many people rely on our sources including business people. This downtime is just not acceptable for me.&lt;/p&gt;

Note, that the behaviour used in this article is the default one used in almost all Windows apps. This article is actually using the old-school DND code, using the awt package.The new jdk1.4 DND code, guess what, doesn't support dropping of folders &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; other folders. It just supports dropping folders &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; other folders.Any suggestions here?&lt;/p&gt;
