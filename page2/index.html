  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/tree/master">jeweler</a> for ruby-config and am very surprised how smooth everything went. What I especially like about jeweler is that its absolutely a no-brainer to create gems and post them via github. And with the versioning support its a joy to push out new releases! Am probably going to move over my hoe based projects to jeweler now.So, in order to get started with jeweler you have to install the jeweler gem first:<code>gem install technicalpickles-jeweler</code>Next to bootstrap a new project you do:<code>jeweler --create-repo --summary "Ruby-Config" ruby-config</code>This will create a project skeleton with all the usual candidates. What&#8217;s left to do now is edit the Rakefile to setup the gem configuration and adding some sourcecode. Don&#8217;t forget the tests!Now, you simply create an initial version with:<code>rake version:write MAJOR=0 MINOR=1 PATCH=0</code>which update the VERSION file in your project for you.When you do a &#8220;rake release&#8221;, jeweler will create a new gemspec file for you, commit and push the update, create a version tag and push it, too.When simply updating a minor feature, I do a &#8220;rake version:bump:minor&#8221; and afterwards a &#8220;rake release&#8221; and I&#8217;m done. Great stuff!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have been doing some more work on ruby-config again. First of all there&#8217;s finally some documentation available in the <a href="http://github.com/fdietz/ruby-config/blob/fc973b5e0d35113593c0912e58113e4fe5167ac9/README.md">Readme</a> file.Also one can now use &#8220;ruby-config &#8211;setup&#8221; which helps configuring bash&#8217;s profile to set the ruby and gem paths correctly. Again, this is done really unobtrusive. First, the task shows you what changes it wants to do, then it prompts you for a yes or no. You can always cancel and apply the changes manually.I&#8217;ve generated a new gem spec with version 0.5. So, please upgrade!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just posted a preliminary version of my <a href="https://github.com/fdietz/jwz_threading/tree">jwz threading library</a> on GitHub. Took me the whole day to get a first project including complete set of Rake tests up and running.Since I&#8217;m still <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/08/gems-from-rubyforge-and-github">not sure if posting gems via GitHub is sufficient</a>, I&#8217;ve registered a new project on <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">RubyForge</a>. <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/04/08/git-for-rubyforge-accounts/">They now support Git</a> too, which makes it super easy to push my changes to both &#8220;hubs&#8221;. So, you will most probably be able to download some ruby gems soon!Now, that the setup phase is done I can concentrate on cleaning up my <a href="http://rspec.info/">specs</a> and getting the API design right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just saw an <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/ruby-open-classes-monkeypatching">article</a> related to my <a href="http://fdietz.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/symbolto_proc-what/">last post</a> about Symbol#to_proc. Very interesting read! And even more fun is this article which explains the same mechanism and <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/to_proc-currying-ruby19">currying</a> on top:[sourcecode language=&#8221;ruby&#8221;]proc {|x, y, z| x + y + z }.curry[/sourcecode]returns the equivalent of:[sourcecode language=&#8221;ruby&#8221;]proc {|x| proc {|y| proc {|z| x + y + z } } }[/sourcecode]Here&#8217;s the example:[sourcecode language=&#8221;ruby&#8221;]plus_five = proc { |x,y,z| x + y + z }.curry.call(2).call(3)plus_five[10]  #=> 15[/sourcecode]I&#8217;ve seen something similar in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. A good explanation of Scala function currying can be found in <a href="http://www.codecommit.com/blog/scala/function-currying-in-scala">Daniel Spiewak&#8217;s blog</a>. BTW, Scala finally got a new website! And even better: Just got an E-Mail from <a href="http://www.artima.com/">Artima.com</a> that the 4th edition of &#8221;<a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala">Programming in Scala</a>&#8221; arrived.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>While reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Rails-Brad-Ediger/dp/0596510322/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_a">Advanced Rails</a> by Brad Ediger, I&#8217;ve stumbled upon this little helper in ActiveSupport.</p>

<p>The to_proc method is an extension to Symbol. Let me shamelessly copy Brad&#8217;s example here:</p>

<div><figure role=code><pre><code>(1..5).map { |i| i.to_s } # => ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]</code></pre></figure></div>


<p>This is already pretty nice, but now look what happens when using Symbol#to_proc:</p>

<div><figure role=code><pre><code>(1..5).map(&:to_s) # => ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]</code></pre></figure></div>


<p>This is even shorter and does produce exactly the same output. So what happened here? The &#8220;&amp;&#8221; character tells Ruby that you want to call map with &#8220;to_s&#8221; as a block argument. It will force Ruby to call the Symbol&#8217;s to_proc method. The method will create a Proc and send the symbol to the object calling the to_proc method. And this leads to iterating over the numbers specified by the range and then calling the block, passing in the numbers and converting them to strings. Okay&#8230;</p>

<p>This is a typical example of me not being able to figure out what some code actually means and then by accident finding the explanation somewhere else. How the heck am I supposed to know where to find the documentation to such a cool extensions? I will let you know when I&#8217;m finally able to solve this mystery&#8230;</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A question which came up real quick was how to add a foreign key to your migrations. In my example rails app I&#8217;m using a project with a has_many association to tasks, like this:[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  has_many :tasksendclass Task &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :projectend[/sourcecode]Now I want my task database to look like the following:<pre>mysql&gt; describe tasks;+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+| Field      | Type         | Null | Key | Default |+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+| id         | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    || title      | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    || body       | text         | YES  |     | NULL    || status     | tinyint(1)   | YES  |     | NULL    || created_at | datetime     | YES  |     | NULL    || updated_at | datetime     | YES  |     | NULL    || project_id | int(11)      | NO   | MUL | NULL    |+------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+7 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>Note, that I&#8217;ve removed the last &#8220;extra&#8221; column which is usually shown by the MySQL describe command. It only shows the auto_increment for the primary key but it would have overlapped my fixed-width wordpress theme.First we have to create a new migration for adding a new column using:<pre>script/generate migration add_project_column</pre>This will generate an initial ruby file where I only added the two lines to add and delete a column.[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]class AddProjectColumn &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration  def self.up    add_column :tasks, :project_id, :integer, :null => false  end  def self.down    delete_column :tasks, :project_id  endend[/sourcecode]Next step is the foreign key which we can put directly in the migration, like this:[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]class AddProjectColumn &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration  def self.up    add_column :tasks, :project_id, :integer, :null => false    execute &#8216;ALTER TABLE tasks ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tasks_projects FOREIGN KEY ( project_id ) references projects( id )&#8217;  end  def self.down    delete_column :tasks, :project_id    execute &#8216;ALTER TABLE tasks DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_tasks_projects&#8217;  endend[/sourcecode]Note, that I&#8217;m actually executing a MySQL command to add a foreign key. So, this code most probably won&#8217;t work when used with different databases.For now this is good enough, but I should probably look into refactoring these two lines by extracting them into a migration helper class. This way it will be easier to modify in a single central place in case the database will be changed.I&#8217;m still searching for database independent foreign key management handled in migrations. So, please let me know if you find a better way to do this! Until then some more <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UsingMigrations">readings</a>&#8230;</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m more used to Java ORM frameworks as for example JPA and Hibernate but started to play around with ActiveRecord lately. Probably all has been said already and I will spare you the introduction and point you to some <a href="http://rails-doc.org/rails/ActiveRecord/Base">documentation</a> instead. It took me some time to realize that there is much more than what is shown mostly in online articles, blog postings and books. Let&#8217;s start with the typical example of a book model containing articles defined with a simple has_many relation.[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  has_many :chaptersendclass Chapter &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :bookend[/sourcecode]A typical query for all books would then look like this:[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]Book.find(:all)[/sourcecode]and a query for all published books would be something similar to:[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]Book.find(:all, :conditions => [ &#8216;status = ?&#8217;, false])[/sourcecode]Now to simplify this we can instead use the dynamic finder:[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]Book.find_all_by_status(false)[/sourcecode]Until now this is pretty straightforward, but now comes the interesting part. Imagine now that you have got a book and you want to retrieve a list of chapters:[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]@book = Book.find(params[:id])@chapters = @book.chapters.find_all_by_title(title)[/sourcecode]Notice how one can use the same dynamic finders directly on the child association? Much easier than making a query using the book_id foreign key in the chapters table! In fact, ActiveRecord automatically makes the class-level methods of the Chapter model available directly for the associations. This also works in case you have added your own finder methods in the model.[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]class Chapter &lt; ActiveRecord::Base  belongs_to :book  def self.find_finished    Chapter.find_all_by_status(false)  endend[/sourcecode]Note, the &#8220;self&#8221; since we are adding a class-level method to Chapter. ActiveRecord will automatically make this now available in the association:[sourcecode language=&#8217;ruby&#8217;]@chapters = @book.chapters.find_finished[/sourcecode]Hope you got the idea. It simply is beautiful. Next time we should probably look into what&#8217;s behind the <a href="http://rails-doc.org/rails/ActiveRecord/Base/find/class">dynamic finder method</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve attended the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/events/techtalks/europe.html">Leopard Tech Talk</a> last week in Düsseldorf. The tech talks are a great opportunity to meet other Mac developers face-to-face. Apple experts gave presentations about the latest Leopard development.  I&#8217;m not really counting me in as a Mac developer, as I was always more of a Java Swing guy. But the Mac OS X as a development platform and especially its aesthetics are quite appealing to me and were always and inspiration. The latest &#8220;official &#8220;support for Ruby, specifically the <a href="http://rubyosa.rubyforge.org/">RubyOSA</a> and <a href="http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/">Ruby Cocoa</a>, make things even more interesting.But, lets come to more interesting things. You&#8217;ve probably all read about those <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/">300+ new Leopard</a> features ;-) So, I&#8217;m not going to list them all here for you again. I only sum up the little niceties which you probably won&#8217;t have read that often&#8230; <br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Resolution Independence</span> was the first topic. This gets more and more important as people&#8217;s displays become bigger. I run a 20&#8221; wide screen, so no problem here yet. You can actually play around with the DPI numbers with the Quartz Debug tool, located in &#8220;Developer Applications-&gt; Graphics Tools&#8221;. Most application look pretty good already, expect funnily the Finder which is still pretty much thinking in pixels here. <br />Next came<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Spotlight</span>, which not only lets you search for menu items out-of-the-box, but also lets you index your whole user interfaces. Think of a completed configuration dialog where it might help to search for a specific option. If you are a Java Developer for yourself, you most probably used the search box in the Eclipse Preferences Dialog&#8230; Only thing you have to do to activate this is to tell xcode to index your user interface. Oh and by the way - it seems that Spotlight might be able to also search os servers in the future and not only on your local hard drive. Something else I didn&#8217;t know is that Spotlight is most importantly an API which can be used inside your application, too. Nice!<br />Then we have of course the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">64 bit support in Leopard</span> now in much more places, even in Java 6 which is hopefully shipping soon. Nobody knows when and why it takes that long, but we&#8217;ll see. No reason yet to panic and sell my Macbook Pro <em>hehe</em><br />The <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Core Animation Library</span> was next and this one is actually funny as it wasn&#8217;t development for Leopard specifically, but first appeared somewhere else. Rumor&#8217;s tell it was the iPhone. That reminds me that I should look into Chet Haase&#8217;s <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/chet/archive/2007/10/move_it.html">Animation and Transition Library</a>, after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132413930?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=filriccli-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0132413930">Filthy Rich Clients</a>&#8230;<br />Next was <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Time Machine</span>. I didn&#8217;t know that one can actually restore a complete system by using the Migration Assistant which comes with the Leopard Installer. Still, haven&#8217;t got the time yet to buy me a new external hard drive. Also very cool is that Spotlight is Time Machine aware and can actually show several older revisions as search result.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;"> Automator</span> has gotten some new flow controls and rules. Additionally, a cool virtual user recording lets you basically record macros. Lets see if this works as good as in Photoshop. Did I mention the AppleScript bridges for Python and Ruby yet?<br />Then comes of course <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Objective-C 2.0</span>, which now supports Garbage Collection which the Apple engineers have been tinkering about for a dozen years but now seem to have found a way to make this work really well. Appearantly, they managed the generational (incremental) Garbage Collector to run faster then the manual retain and release. Then also very nice is the properties support, which has been discussed in length for Java, too. They use an easy dot notation as almost everyone else. Exceptions have been optimized, now the throwing is expense but the try is cheap. In older versions it was the other way around.<br />Last thing I found very interesting was the Image related libraries including <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Image I/O</span> for reading and writing various file formats and metadata including RAW formats and high dynamic range support. Then <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">ImageKit</span> which offers some nice of the self components to find, browse, display and edit images. And last but not least the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:bold;">Core Imag</span>e, which is actually using the GPU for all its image processing - thing OpenGL. It offers more than 100 common image processing filters, basically the usual candidates you wouldn&#8217;t want to miss in Photoshop.<br />That&#8217;s it for today. On a last note, the food was excellent ;-) and the Mac crowd quite friendly with more than 200 visitors. I&#8217;m off for today, heading to Frankfurt, Germany tomorrow for the Java Tech Days! Meet you there. </p>
